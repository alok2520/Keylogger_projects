A keylogger is defined as a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.

Keyloggers can be both physical keyloggers and software keyloggers.

The keylogger code above can be embedded with backdoor and can be combined with an image to create a clickable image so that on when the victim clicks on the image opens a backdoor on the target system.

Happy Hunting!!!
